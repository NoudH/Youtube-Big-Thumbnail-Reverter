## What happened?
Someone at Youtube thought it would be a good idea to make the thumbnails of videos visible from outer space (or at least from across the room).

## Why is this a problem?
It makes scrolling through your recommended list annoying with only being able to see 6-8 videos at a time.

## For who is this project meant?
Everyone that does not want to scroll 3 minutes to go through their recommended list or just people who do not like the looks of the current style.

## Installation
This stylesheet can be used with extensions like Stylus ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) / [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)) or any extension that allows you to inject your own stylesheets on a website.

## Options
You can change things like the amount of videos per row using the variables at the top of the stylesheet.css file.

## Please note
This stylesheet was made based on a screenshot I took a couple of days before youtube hit me with the big thumbnails update. However, since I only made a screenshot of my screen at it's native resolution (1920x1080p), this stylesheet might not have the same result on other resolutions. If this is the case, please use the issue tracker above (please provide a screenshot of what it should look like or your own css implemention/fixes).
